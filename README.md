 # Adapter Pattern 

Little Kata in java to practise easily the implementation of Adapter pattern

We have an application where you can create a song or a fly lesson from Birds kata.Canary and kata.Sparrow. 

We need to add new “birds” a Bat, MagicPotato and Duck , but this classes can not be modify and they do not have the methods necessary to use our existing implantation.

You need to use the Adapter Pattern to find a solution.

## Getting Started

Check out `start` branch and run maven package on the `[AdapterPatternBefore](AdapterPatternBefore)` folder.

### Prerequisites

maven, java

## Running the tests

`mvn test` or run in IDE
